<h1>Illusionary</h1>
<h4>Theme 6 Project description</h4>
<p>Our project is an education platform that educates users on the misconceptions people have with Disabilities and share how these people experience the world.</p>

<h3>Design Process<h3>
<p>Our website was made to increase awareness for people with different types of disabilities. Hence my group had to cater the website to ensuring that people could understand the struggles that others with disabilities face in the working world. Our group’s website aims to clear these misconceptions through the use of a community and learning page. The learning page acts as a well of knowledge for more people to access sources which are accurate so that more people can then spread the word to others who do not use the website about these things within their own friend groups. Furthermore, users can clear their doubts using the community page which allow different users with different lives to speak out about their different types of disabilities to show how every person’s struggle is unique due to each of their circumstances and how people often tend to generalise things due to how the media often portray these disabilities.</p> 
<p>The reason why we think our application would work is because the application allows users with disabilities to post via the community section about their struggles. These people can also post about common misconceptions that they feel are accurate from reliable websites in the misconception page. Our application also allows users to share more beyond their disabilities and show the different kinds of hobbies and interests that they may have that is not often shown in the media setting. The learning page also allows organisations such as CHADD to join and make their own page via the website to allow more people to view these websites and be able to volunteer at these organisations. This can raise more awareness and allow more people to spread the word about the organisation and the app which allows both to attract more people towards the same cause.</p>
<p>During the designing process, we decided to use pastel colours instead of bright colours. The reason for this is because we wanted to target the large community of people who do have different types of disabilities. Bright colours as such may be overstimulating to others who may otherwise find the colours alright to their eyes. </p>
<h5>User Stories:<h5>
<p> - As a visitor, I would like to be able to access different pages within the website to see what the website can offer in terms of knowledge and community presence.</p>
<p> - As a user, I would like to be able to post in the post page so that I can allow more people to read up on the common misconception others have for different disabilities.</p>
<p> - As a user, I would like to be able to post about certain things I have experienced which I do not agree with in the community page.</p>
<p> - As a user, I would like to be able to find the disability that I have in either the mental or physical category so that I can write about my own experiences which contradicts what the media portrays in the new post page.</p>
<p> - As a charitable organisation, I would like to be able to access the contact page so that I am able to easily contact the makers of the website for a collaboration through the organisation page.</p>
<p> As a user, I would like to see what post I have made in the community page and whether these posts have comments in them.</p>

<h3>Current features:<h3>
<p>Feature 1.) Allow users to login. If the player writes in a username or password that is not found in the database an error page will show up.</p>
<p>Feature 2.) Allows users to sign up. This allows new users to input their email, username and password which is then sent to the database to be stored for when they log back into the website again.</p>
<p>Feature 3.) Allow users to access buttons in the main page. These buttons consist of the community page, learning page, sign out, home and contact page. All these buttons are clickable and bring each user to a different page within the website.
<p>Feature 4.) The main page also contains different boxes labelled as ‘Follows’, ‘Likes’ and ‘Points’. These boxes allow users to see how many followers, likes and points they have.
<p> Feature 5.) In the learning page, viewers can view a 3D model of a brain and wheelchair. The players can then choose to either click onto the ‘mental’ or ‘physical’ button which then sends the players to two separate pages of their choice.</p>
<p>Feature 6.) Clicking onto either buttons sends the player to a page that allows them to click onto different disabilities related to either the brain or the physical body. Players can then choose between these disabilities through various buttons which each have a different coloured ribbon for the representation of their disabilities.
<p>Feature 7.) When players click onto any of the buttons with the disabilities names, they are then sent to the definition page. At the top of the definition page, there are different buttons such as the ‘Definition’, ‘Misconception’, ‘Organisation’ and ‘Post’ Buttons. Each button sends the user these different pages.
<p>Feature 8.) The definition page allows users to see a medical description of what the different disabilities are medically. These pages also has a ‘Did You Know?’ that talks about how the ribbon is associated with their disability and the month when these different disabilities are celebrated. This allows users to learn more about these different disabilities.
<p>Feature 9.) The misconception page contains post from different users talking about different misconceptions which is often related to the disability of the page. This page allows users to read up on these misconceptions and gain more knowledge about these different disabilities so that they are more understanding about these people.</p>
<p>Feature 10.) The organisation page contains a short synopsis of what certain organisations related to the disability do and their contact details. This allows users to access their website and receive more useful information on what they can do to help from these pages.</p>
<p>Feature 11.) The post page contains two buttons named ‘Editing’ and ‘New Post’. Clicking onto these buttons sends users to the two separate pages.
<p>Feature 12.) In the post page, users can also press the back button to go out to the definition page if they do not wish to make any changes or make new post to the misconception page.</p>
<p>Feature 13.) In the main page, clicking onto the logo sends users to the contact page. Users can then reference or click onto these links to send them to the company’s various contact pages such as email, Instagram, etc.
<p>Feature 14.) In the main page, clicking onto the sign out page sends users back to the login page when they choose to stop using the website.

<h3>Future features:<h3>
<p>Feature 1) In the main page, we plan to implement a way for users to change their profile pictures. This can be done through making the profile picture a button through which users can then be sent to a different page and be able to access their laptop or computer pictures for suitable profile pictures.</p>
<p>Feature 2) In the main page, we plan to implement a helper role button. This button will then send users to a voucher redemption page which will then allow them to use vouchers within the application to gain certain discounts for stores within Singapore. When players click onto a ‘redeem’ button below the voucher, a QR code will then appear on the users page which can then be redeemed. The voucher page will also contain a back button which will allow users to go back to the main page.</p>
<p>Feature 3) In the main page, the players can see how many followers, likes and points they have. In the future, the number of followers, likes and points can increase when players do certain actions such as posting in the misconception page and commenting with useful information on another users post if they have the hashtag ‘help’ on their post.</p>
<p>Feature 4) In the main page, players can see how many posts they have. In the future, we plan to implement a feature where players can see what post they have made to the community. They can also click onto these post be able to see what others have commented in these posts.</p>
<p>Feature 5.) In the Editing page, we plan to implement a feature where users can access their old post which they have posted in the misconception page through the ‘Select Post’ box. Users can then edit them so that the post can more accurately portray what their intended message is in the ‘Edit’ box before resending the message again to the misconception page. These messages are then verified by the bot before the user can see their new edited post in a separate page.</p>
<p>Feature 6.) In the New Post page, we plan to implement features where the user can write what website they have referenced their information from in the ‘Website Source’ box. The user can then write down what they want to write in the ‘Post’ box before they send the information to the misconception page. A bot will then verify these posts before they are then sent to the misconception page. Users can see their post in a separate page.</p>
<p>Feature 7.) After posting a new post, we plan to implement a new feature where the user can then see a page which informs them that they’ve earned twenty points. If the user earns enough points, they can also receive a notification that they’ve earned the ‘helper role’ in the website.
<p>Feature 8.) In the community page, we plan to implement a feature where users can see other post which other users have posted. Each post contains a different hashtag which affects what features are available within the post.</p>
<p>Feature 9.) Each post has a like and comment button while a comment only has a like button. Using the like button causes the number of likes for a player to increase. The comment button allows users to write comments based on how they feel about a certain post.</p>
<p>Feature 10.) One post hashtag known as ‘help’ will be implemented in the future. The ‘help’ hashtag allow players within the community to post useful information that the poster may be unsure of in the post. The poster can then decide which comments are useful and tick onto the comment to award the players with points for their contributions. Other users who have commented on the post can then see if their own post has been ticked or not through the indication of a pink tick on their comment.</p>
<p>Feature 11.) There will also be a hamburger menu which allows users to access the ‘Create’ and ‘Chat’ buttons within the community.</p>
<p>Feature 12.) The search button will be implemented in the future where users are sent to a different page with just the search button. The search button allows users to search for other different users and click onto their username.</p>
<p>Feature 13.) After users have clicked onto the username of their choice, they are then sent to the user’s profile page. The profile page will show similar features to the one that the player can see in their own profile.</p>
<p>Feature 14.) Users within the other user’s profile page can choose to click onto the users old posts. They can then see what comments this user has on their post as well as liking the post and comments in that post.</p>
<p>Feature 15.) Users within the other user’s profile page can also choose to follow the player. This increases the number of follower’s a user has on their profile page.</p>
<p>Feature 16.) In the comment page and chat page, users can access the emoticon tab. This tab allows users to add emoticons to their messages or comments before they send it to a post or message.</p>
<p>Feature 17.) In the chat page, users can access the request page. The request page allows users to accept friend request or group joins from others. Group joins are attained via roles such as the ‘helper’ role. Users can also choose to ignore these request if they wish to.</p>
<p>Feature 18.) Should a request be accepted, players can then click through their chats through an arrow button which allow them to access their different chats when they need to.</p>
<p>Feature 19.) The chat page then allows these players to chat with other users once they have accepted a request through the chat function.</p>
<p>Feature 20.) In the request page, users can also send a friend request to any user within the website. Once the request has been sent, the friend request will show up as a pending which users can check to see whether the user has accepted or refused the friend request via scrolling through their chat arrow buttons.</p>
<p>Feature 21.) In the create page, users can choose to write a title, post text and tag. The post text can be switched between a text box, image or video post.</p>
<p>Feature 22.) The tag function in the create post determines what other functions may be added to a post. For example, a ‘help’ tag would allows the user who posted a post to tick onto comments which they feel are useful. This allows more users to earn points and to be more willing to answer other people’s questions regarding certain misconceptions or confusions they may have.</p>
<p>Feature 23.) After users have finished making their post, users can then send their post which is then verified by a bot before the users are sent to a page to show that their post has been posted. If their post comes with other specific functions, there will be instructions showing the users what these functions are and how to use these functions.</p>
